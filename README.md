# ROLLA 2

## Proper Version of my ROLLA script. The old one I made years ago.

### Purpose:
A command line-based dice-rolling software.

Written with JavaScript.


### Usage:

Upon executing rollmain.js, the program takes an argument from the command-line interface. The syntax is {number of dice}d{type of dice} exactly. All one word. Examples of correct arguments are: 1d20, 5d6, 3d4.

An example command would be: node rollmain.js 5d8
